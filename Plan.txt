Brief idea about the project:
This is a mini social networking site loosely based on the idea of Sarahah but slightly modified. Basically it will have a certain list of teachers and you can choose to anonymously compliment any one in those lists. As of now, it will be invitation only. We will be having a pre-mentioned list of email address and incase anyone of those email ids decide to sign up, we will be sending them a pre-generated password to their email id. After logging in with that pre-generated password and email id, they can post, like on any of the previous posts, filter by teacher or simply send Gratitude to any one of the teachers.

There will be 3 sections-Wall: Here all the messages, gratitudes and likes will be shown. You will also be able to filter posts based on most recent/oldest, most popular or Random(I am feeling lucky).
For wall messages, we need to have a CHAR LIMIT: PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE 200 CHARACTERS
Question forum (Perhaps non-anonymous or perhaps could open just a day before the event): For asking questions directly to a particular teacher or generally to some teacher
Moderator portal-A portal for all the incoming messages to be moderated and filtered out(Based on a voting system)
Individual Profiles: For going to an individual profile(Gratitudes,His/her wall sorted by likes and questions) to be shown


Technical part: The whole thing will be based on Django and AngularJS. The front end and back end will be loosely coupled interacting only using REST.
