Brief idea about the project:
This is a mini social networking site loosely based on the idea of Sarahah but slightly modified. Basically it will have a certain list of teachers and you can choose to anonymously compliment any one in those lists. As of now, it will be invitation only. We will be having a pre-mentioned list of email address and incase anyone of those email ids decide to sign up, we will be sending them a pre-generated password to their email id. After logging in with that pre-generated password and email id, they can post, like on any of the previous posts, filter by teacher or simply send Gratitude to any one of the teachers.
